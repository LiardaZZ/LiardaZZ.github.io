                        <p>
                            The most common description of a narcissist addresses the self-centered, self-absorbed nature of a person and the obsessive concern about appearances and positive self-regard. We throw the word around about people who have never met a mirror they didn't like or who brag or embellish their personal successes and belittle or show disinterest to the achievements of others. If you find yourself with someone who seems to be incapable of receiving enough praise or who subsumes you into her own identity, you may very well be hanging out with a narcissist.

                            The upside of being with a narcissist occurs when she has merged your two identities into one and she sees you as a powerful and pleasing extension of herself. In the early stages of a relationship, this merging of selves can be intoxicating and satisfying. It doesn't last, though, once you begin to assert your independence and individual identity along with your likes, dislikes, preferences, and so on. Yet letting go is not as easy for a narcissist as one might like; when a person's deepest fears are rooted in limits and powerlessness, letting go of a failing relationship brings a narcissist face-to-face with these most combustible and incendiary fears.
