                        <p>
                            Sometimes, the most significant sign that you may be a narcissist arrives in the form of a string of accusations by romantic partners and others. Hearing the words, &#34;You are such a narcissist!&#34; typically leads us into an immediate denial and pose of indifference. This is totally natural&ndash;narcissists are masters at rejecting any form of criticism of themselves. &#34;You always expect me to do what you want, but you never do what I'd like to do&#34; is another criticism that you may have heard from people in your life, if you have narcissistic tendencies. &#34;I don't want to wear that, I prefer this,&#34; is something you may have heard as you've tried to assert your will that your partner reflect your merged identity and appear in the way that you find most pleasing. &#34;Why can't you be happy for me when my life is going right?&#34; may be a complaint you've heard. Narcissists have such fragile egos that they feel threatened when others, even friends and partners, meet success.
                            <br><br>
                            When you find yourself tying up your own self-worth and self-esteem into the experiences and emotions of others, that's a symptom that your ego system is out of balance. It's seldom a narcissist's own self-awareness registers that something is wrong, but if you keep hearing the same complaints or realizing the same unpleasant relationship patterns, perhaps a visit to a counselor might shed some light on the role that you are playing in relationships and bring some suggestions for building a relationship grounded in healthy emotional connection. It's not easy being in a relationship in which narcissism is present; before you can find a cure, there has to be acknowledgement of the problem.
