                            Sometimes, the most significant sign that you may be a narcissist arrives in the form of a string of accusations by romantic partners and others. Hearing the words, &#34;You are such a narcissist!&#34; typically leads us into an immediate denial and pose of indifference. This is totally natural&ndash;narcissists are masters at rejecting any form of criticism of themselves. &#34;You always expect me to do what you want, but you never do what I'd like to do&#34; is another criticism that you may have heard from people in your life, if you have narcissistic tendencies. &#34;I don't want to wear that, I prefer this,&#34; is something you may have heard as you've tried to assert your will that your partner reflect your merged identity and appear in the way that you find most pleasing. &#34;Why can't you be happy for me when my life is going right?&#34; may be a complaint you've heard. Narcissists have such fragile egos that they feel threatened when others, even friends and partners, meet success.

                            The most common description of a narcissist addresses the self-centered, self-absorbed nature of a person and the obsessive concern about appearances and positive self-regard. We throw the word around about people who have never met a mirror they didn't like or who brag or embellish their personal successes and belittle or show disinterest to the achievements of others. If you find yourself with someone who seems to be incapable of receiving enough praise or who subsumes you into her own identity, you may very well be hanging out with a narcissist.
